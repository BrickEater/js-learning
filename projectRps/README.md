I guess I'll plan out this rock paper scissors game here as well as document my progress the way I typically do.

The player needs to be able to select one of the options so I guess I can put in three buttons, one for each option and have a listener.

The computer player needs to randomly select an option.

There needs to be an if/else statement for the win condition or tie condition.

Remember that you can make ifs for all wins and elses for the rest, no need to make a statement for every single outcome when you can blanket it with an else.

25/11/2022 - Just made a function to randomize a number between 1 and 3 and it was very clumsy. Strangely clumsy. I'm going to keep doing it like this because it seems like the common way to do this but surprisingly roundabout for something so common.
