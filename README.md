13/11/2022 - It is wild how boring this shit is. Learning about variables sucks and I would much rather get fucked up in the middle of coding by not knowing how variables work than reading about them and speculating on how I could fuck myself up. It's a dumb way to learn. Better to give me a task that deliberately traps me with weird situations instead of telling me the nono's and hope I remember all this dumb shit. I should say, though, that learning that JS isn't good for math at a granular level was interesting. There are weird rounding errors that happen at work that I have to tell our clients about and I hate it. I feel like we should import Python or something to do the math and export the values. I don't know if that is a thing but I have no idea why we have rounding issues and inconsistent sigfigs. Drives my nuts.

13/11/2022 - Ok, so the process is to make the repos on github, copy the SSH to clone it, go to the directory you wish to have the git in (this will create the folder and the files within so make sure you didn't make a folder for this), then use the "git clone <SSH>" command. From here it seems I can make commits and push like normal. There may be an issue with making repos like this but I can't see it at this point.

13/11/2022 - I'm very bad at making new repos and I get confused at what the best process is. I should document it this time so I don't get confused in the future.
