26/11/2022 - I got the RPS game working. I make a few different mistakes but realized early the problem. Honestly, they seem like the kind of mistakes that you could make an have no idea what the fuck is going on. The major thing was I made 2 functions that picked rock, paper, or scissors for the computer and the player and I would call them each time I printed to the consol but since these functions have a rng in them they would change very time I called the function. I changed it so be a variable that has the function assigned to it and called the variable in the console logs so it was only calling the function once.

25/11/2022 - I have to make a rock paper scissors game and I think it should be fine. I feel like I've made something like this in other languages and the tik tak toe game I did in react should be a big help. I'll make some. I'll probably make an internal readme for the game itself to plan it out and have some pseudocode in there.

24/11/2022 - This error stuff suggests that the error messages should be enough to let the programmer know what the issues is. That understanding the error messages well would lead to a lot of streamlined debugging. It does make me think, though, that there may not be tools that are intuitive enough to identify some simple mistakes. A TypeError seems like a simple thing to correct if you try and pass a function that requires a string but you are passing it an array. Certainly someone has made something that says "expecting a string" when this happens... It's probably not that simple if there isn't something like that.

24/11/2022 - I just realized that error messages are from a system that is built into the language or compiler maybe (??) and it is a necessity to have. I don't know why this never clicked before but it makes sense that it was made to solve a functional issue. I should put more effort into understanding error messages as a whole and how they occur. There would be a limited number of them and all of them would identify very specific things. There is even a chance that error messages aren't specific enough for some issues or that some issues would be missed and not produce an error message.

24/11/2022 - Finished the problem solving assignment. It was pretty straight forward, it mostly talked about for loops, if/else conditions, and how JS but most languages process sequentially, top down, left to right, just like reading.

21/11/2022 - Finally got to do some coding again. Lots of reading in The Odin Project and I actually find it annoying. I don't mind reading the documentation when I know why I'm reading it but it feels like they just throw all the documentation at you and hope it all sticks and then give you the easiest shit in the world to do as the assignment. It feels like the scene in Golden Boy where he claims to know how to code but he doesn't own a computer so he writes all his code on paper and has never actually tried it. It feels like the documentation is without context. Anyway, finished the assignment, the final task to take the last letter of a word was pretty heavy handed. I changed the word into an array and then grabbed the last item, then switched the last letter back to a string. Seems like a dumb way to do it but it's done. 

14/11/2022 - This stuff is boring but I'll work my way through it. I'm going to try and read the intro for the next assignment, then skip to the end to see what the practice is, then work backwards from there. I think I'll be more interested in what is going on if I do it this way.

13/11/2022 - It is wild how boring this shit is. Learning about variables sucks and I would much rather get fucked up in the middle of coding by not knowing how variables work than reading about them and speculating on how I could fuck myself up. It's a dumb way to learn. Better to give me a task that deliberately traps me with weird situations instead of telling me the nono's and hope I remember all this dumb shit. I should say, though, that learning that JS isn't good for math at a granular level was interesting. There are weird rounding errors that happen at work that I have to tell our clients about and I hate it. I feel like we should import Python or something to do the math and export the values. I don't know if that is a thing but I have no idea why we have rounding issues and inconsistent sigfigs. Drives my nuts.

13/11/2022 - Ok, so the process is to make the repos on github, copy the SSH to clone it, go to the directory you wish to have the git in (this will create the folder and the files within so make sure you didn't make a folder for this), then use the "git clone <SSH>" command. From here it seems I can make commits and push like normal. There may be an issue with making repos like this but I can't see it at this point.

13/11/2022 - I'm very bad at making new repos and I get confused at what the best process is. I should document it this time so I don't get confused in the future.
